In order to compile the benchmarks run the command:
CC_CROSS=your_compiler CFLAGS=your_cflags make
remember to specify -DBIG_TARGET among the cflags in case you want to test
a big endian processor. For example, for the LEON3 processor:
CC_CROSS=/home/luke/cross/sparc/bin/sparc-elf-gcc CFLAGS="-DBIG_TARGET -specs=osemu.specs" make

Once compiled, to run the benchmarks execute:
SIMULATOR=your_simulator make run
for exmple:
SIMULATOR=/home/luke/temp/processor/_build_/default/funcLT/funcLT make run

After benchmarks execution you shall get a summary of the simulator performance
all over the benchmarks
